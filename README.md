# Python for Data Science

Welcome to the repository for the course "Introduction to Python: Python 101". This course is designed to introduce you to the world of data science using Python, one of the most popular languages for data analysis and machine learning.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into four sessions, each focusing on Pythonic best practices and features. The core material for each session is included in this repository.

1. **Session 1**: Brief intro to Python + tool set-up
    - Overview of the Python programming language,
    - Any leftover set-up / a look around the Azure Machine Learning workspace,
    - Best practices for working with Azure Machine Learning. 

2. **Session 2**: Data types, functions and best practices with Python & notebooks
    

3. **Session 3**: Virtual environments and packages
    - A dive into the Python Standard Library,
    - Introduction to package management and installation,
    - A brief look at virtual environments.

4. **Session 4**: Interacting with external APIs and SDKs for additional functionality
    - Interacting with the Azure Machine Learning Studio via the Python SDK v2,
    - Calling external APIs using the `requests` library
    - Set-up the capstone project

## Homework Notebooks

In addition to the core material, this repository also contains optional homework notebooks for self-led learning. These notebooks provide additional exercises and challenges to help reinforce what you've learned in the sessions. There is also the `archive` directory that contains the old notebooks from the first bootcamp, feel free to take a look over if you would like more content to cement your understanding!

## Prerequisites

This course assumes no prior knowledge and only requires access to a compute instance within an Azure Machine Learning workspace as well as to the Azure Cognitive Service suite including Azure OpenAI.

## Getting Started

To get started with the course, clone this repository to your Azure Machine Learning workspace. You can then navigate to the session folders to access the course materials.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ejones18/python-for-data-science.git
git checkout summer_bootcamp
cd python-for-data-science
```
