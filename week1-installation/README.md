# Week 1 - Introduction to Python / environment set-up

Hello and welcome to the first week of the Python 101 course! This week's homework is quite lightweight and focuses more on finishing any set-up and getting comfortable with the basics before starting on the learning journey! Each week will have a few notebooks for you to work through at your own pace to help upskill alongside the sessions.

If you're new with notebooks, please review the `intro-to-notebooks` file in this directory for a brief overview.
