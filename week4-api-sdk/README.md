# Week 4 - Interacting with external APIs and using the Azure ML SDK

Welcome to the final weeks' content for the Python 101 course; yes, we're almost there! This week we will focus on calling external APIs and using the Azure ML SDK to add even more funcionality to our Python skillset - this will then set-up for the capstone project that will put all your new skills to the test!

## The 'requests' library

The Python requests package is a popular HTTP library for making HTTP requests in Python. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a simple API, allowing you to send HTTP/1.1 requests with various methods like GET, POST, and others. With it, you can add content like headers, form data, multipart files, and parameters to HTTP requests via simple Python libraries to HTTP requests.

## Python SDK v2 - Azure Machine Learning
The Python Azure ML SDK v2 is an updated software development kit for Azure Machine Learning. It allows users to manage the entire lifecycle of machine learning tasks, from submitting training jobs to managing data, models, and environments. It introduces new features like reusable components for pipelines, standalone local jobs, and managed online/batch inferencing.
