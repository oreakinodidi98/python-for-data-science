# Week 3 - Virtual environments, the Python Standard Library & using packages

This week's content will explore the use of virtual environments, the Python Standard Library and packages. Please take some time to read the additional notes and the relevant links before working through the homework notebooks.

## The Python Standard Library

The Python Standard Library is a collection of modules, which are pre-written pieces of code, that come with Python installation. These modules provide functionalities for a variety of tasks such as file I/O, system calls, string management, internet protocols, and more. It's like a toolbox filled with ready-to-use tools, saving you from writing common functionalities from scratch. To use these modules, you just need to `import` them in your Python script.

## Virtual environments

Python virtual environments (venvs) are isolated environments where you can install Python packages without affecting your system’s Python or other virtual environments. They’re useful for managing project-specific dependencies and avoiding conflicts between packages.

## Installing additional packages

**Python packages** are collections of modules, which are reusable pieces of code, grouped together. They can be shared and installed using **pip**, the Python package installer. Pip allows you to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and other repositories. When you run a command like `pip install <package-name>`, pip downloads and installs the package and its dependencies.
